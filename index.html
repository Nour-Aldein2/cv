  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>
    I have been always facenated by how the universe work. Mathematics provides excellent tools to understand how it functions, with this tool, humans were able to imporve their understanding on the universe and started automating tasks around them.
    AI and quantum computers emarge as applications of different fields that interest me, and therefore I worked and studied to develop the nessassry skills to work on these facinating fields. I started by doing my bachelor's degree in physics, then
    developing computational skills while applying them in productive research in astrophysics, which led me start learning machine learning and AI. This included prgramming with Python and its libaraies such as <strong>NumPy</strong>,
    <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>MatplotLib</strong>, <strong>Seaborn</strong>, <strong>SciKit-Learn</strong>, <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, and many other libaraies. To master machine learning, joing Kaggle competesions was a huge support to
    develop better understanding on techniques used in <em>data prepocessing</em>, <em>visualizing data</em>, <em>ensamble learning</em>, and <em>image recognession</em>.

  The goal of this web page is for me to talk more about projects I worked on, and where did I use my programming experience exactly. Hopfully, in the future I will keep growing this site to add more content that I find interesting.

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <p>
    In this section, I want to talk about my educational journy in a less formal way than I did in my <a href="./files/Noor_Aldeen_CV.pdf">CV</a>. I will focus here on talking about what kind of skill have I developed, and what did I do while I was
    developing them. I will talk about the challenges I encountered and how I overcome them at that time.

  <ul>

    <li><strong>B.Sc in Physics, <a href="https://www.aabu.edu.jo/en/pages/default.aspx">Al Al-Bayt University</a></strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>GPA– 84.5% (Excellent), with first-class honors.</li>
      <li>This is a four-year program with a fast track option delivered in English as the language of instruction. Relevant modules studied include Quantum Physics I (87%), Quantum Physics II (94%), Thermodynamics (90%), Statistical Mechanics (95%),
        Electricity and Magnetism I (74%), Electricity and Magnetism II (77%), Mathematical Physics I (94%), Mathematical Physics II (89%), Mathematical Physics III (95%), Astrophysics (98%), Nuclear Physics (80%), and Particle Physics (94%).</li>
      <li>Final year dissertation ”Heavy Quarkonium Mass Spectra From Complex Potential”; this study was an attempt to improve our under- standing of the heavy mesons (such as the bottomonium) by studying the solution of the relativistic Schrodinger
        equation for some com- plex potential. This project took five months.</li>
    </ul>

    <li><strong>Qiskit Global Summer School on Quantum Machine Learning</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Completed the two-week intensive course which covered many topics in quantum computing such as <em>Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm</em>, <em>Grover’s Algorithm</em>, <em>quantum classifiers</em>, <em>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
          (QAOA)</em>, <em>quantum fidelity</em>, and <em>quantum hardware</em>, completing all graded lab work assignments with a final cumulative score of 100%, demonstrating applied understanding and comfort with and about Quantum Computing and
        Quantum Machine Learning using Qiskit.</li>
    </ul>

    <li><strong>Python</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>There are many things to learn in this programming language, and since I am into AI and machine learning, I focused on learning the nessassry skills to become professiont in these fields. I started with a machine learning bootcamp where I
        learned many of the fundamental algorithms in machine learning such as <em>linear regression</em>, <em>logestic regression</em>, <em>k-nearest neigbors (KNN)</em>, <em>K-means clustering</em>, <em>decision trees</em>, <em>random forests</em>,
        <em>support vector machines (SVM)</em>, etc.</li>
      <li>One of the most useful skills to master as a machine learning practitioner is <em>visualizing data</em>. Furthermore, this skill is helpful when conducting research, like the one I did in astrophysics. Fimiliarizing myself with different
        visualization libaraies in python, such as <code>Matplotlib</code> and <cod>Seaborn</cod>, to create static graphs is a very helpful and cheap way to visualize the data I am working on, and thus build a new intuition of how differet features
        behaive together. However, sometimes, an interactive graph was needed. For that pourpos, I bought a course on Udemy called "Interactive Python Dashboards with Plotly and Dash". Here is an <a href="./figures/titanic2.html">example</a> where I
        used <code>Plotly</code> to create an interactive graph to see the realtionship between gender, age, and fare rate in the data provided in a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic">Kaggle competition</a>.</li>
    </ul>
